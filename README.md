Programs installed:
VS code 
rofi
feh
i3
xorg
picom
chromium
alacritty
pulsemixer
thunar
flameshot
xinput
polybar
pulseaudio

just install all those programs, download the (.)config folder, rename it to .config, put it in your home directory, and restart i3 and you should be good i guess. (Sorry if this is ass i've never really done dotfile sharing before)
